LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 -2024)

Every day, thousands of companies and individuals turn to LinkedIn in search of talent. This dataset contains a nearly comprehensive record of 124,000+ job postings listed in 2023 and 2024. Each posting contains dozens of valuable attributes for both postings and companies, including the title, job description, salary, location, application URL, and work types (remote, contract, etc), in addition to separate files containing the benefits, skills, and industries associated with each posting. The majority of jobs are also linked to a company, which are all listed in another CSV file containing attributes such as the company description, headquarters location, number of employees, and follower count.
With so many data points, the potential for exploration of this dataset is vast and includes exploring the highest compensated titles, companies, and locations; predicting salaries/benefits through NLP,and examining how industries and companies vary through their internship offerings and benefits. Future updates will permit further exploration into time-based trends, including company growth, the prevalence of remote jobs, and the demand for individual job titles over time.
